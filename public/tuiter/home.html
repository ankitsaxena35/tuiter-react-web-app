        <p>Atari (/əˈtɑːri/) is a brand name that has been owned by several entities since its inception in 1972.
            It is currently owned by French publisher Atari SA through a subsidiary named Atari Interactive.[1][2][3]
            The original Atari, Inc., founded in Sunnyvale, California, in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney,
            was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles and home computers. The company's products,
            such as Pong and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to
            the mid-1980s.
